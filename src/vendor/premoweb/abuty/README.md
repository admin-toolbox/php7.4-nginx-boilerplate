### Instalation

```
composer require premoweb/abuty
```

### Benefits
  - Mix and match native F3 routes with MySQL routes.
  - Extendable with a simplistic plugin system.
  - Widget processing system called Dynamics
 
 Fat Free Framework is awesome as it is but I wanted to make it even easier to build richly dynamic websites with as little effort and programming as required.
